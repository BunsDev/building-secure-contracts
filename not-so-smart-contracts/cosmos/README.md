# (Not So) Smart Cosmos

This repository contains examples of common Cosmos application vulnerabilities, including code from real applications. Use Not So Smart Cosmos to learn about Cosmos (Tendermint) vulnerabilities, as a reference for conducting security reviews, and as a benchmark for security and analysis tools.

## Features

Each _Not So Smart Cosmos_ entry provides a standard set of information:

- Description of the vulnerability type
- Attack scenarios to exploit the vulnerability
- Recommendations for eliminating or mitigating the vulnerability
- Real-world contracts that exhibit the flaw
- References to third-party resources with more information
